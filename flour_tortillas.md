# Flour Tortillas

**Type:** Side, Ingredient
**Serves:** 16

## Ingredients:
- 3 cups flour (360g)
- 1 teaspoon salt (6g)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder (4g)
- $\frac{1}{3}$ cup vegetable oil (66g)
- 1 cup warm water (227g)

## Steps:
1. Combine flour, salt and baking powder in mixing bowl. Add oil and water. Mix until dough is smooth.
2. Transfer from mixing bowl to a well-floured work surface. Divide dough into 16 fairly equal portions. Form each piece into a ball and flatten with the palm of your hand. If dough is sticky, use a bit more flour. Cover flattened balls of dough with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for 15 minutes.
3. After rest period, heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Roll each dough piece into a rough circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter, keeping work surface and rolling pin lightly floured. Do not stack.
4. When pan is hot, place one dough circle into pan and allow to cook about 1 minute or until bottom surface has a few pale brown spots. The uncooked surface will begin to show a few little bubbles. If tortilla is browning too fast, reduced heat. If itâ€™s taking longer than a minute to see a few pale golden brown spots on underside of tortillas, increase heat. Flip to other side and cook for about 30 seconds. You want the tortilla to be soft but have a few small pale golden brown spots on surface. Remove from pan with tongs and stack in a covered container or zippered bag till all tortillas are cooked. This will keep them soft and pliable.
5. Wipe out the pan in-between tortillas if flour is started to accumulate.
6. Serve warm or allow to cool for later use. When ready to use, place a slightly damp paper towel in the bottom of a container (with a cover) that will hold the stacked tortillas. Microwave, uncovered, for 15-25 seconds (start with 15) or until warm, then cover to hold heat while serving.
7. The tortillas will keep well stored in an airtight container or zippered bag at room temperature for 24 hours or can be frozen indefinitely. To freeze, separate tortillas with parchment paper or waxed paper and place in a zippered bag before placing in freezer.
