# Lentil Soup

**Type:** Meal
**Serves:** 6

## Ingredients:
- 4 Slices Bacon, Chopped
- 2 Cups Dry Lentils, Rinsed and Drained
- 1 Large Sweet Onion, Diced
- 3 Medium Carrots, Peeled and Chopped
- 2 Stalks Celery, Diced
- 1$\frac{1}{2}$ Tablespoons Garlic, Minced
- $\frac{1}{2}$ Teaspoon Cumin
- $\frac{1}{2}$ Teaspoon Paprika
- $\frac{1}{2}$ Teaspoon Thyme
- $\frac{1}{2}$ Teaspoon Salt
- $\frac{1}{4}$ Teaspoon Pepper
- 1 Bay Leaf
- 8 Cups chicken stock
- 14.5-Ounce can crushed tomatoes

## Steps:
1. In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave the bacon drippings in the pot.
2. Add the carrots, celery and onion to the pot. Cook and stir over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they’re starting to soften.
3. Add the garlic, cumin, paprika, thyme, salt, pepper and bay leaf; cook for 1 more minute.
4. Stir in the lentils, chicken stock, and crushed tomatoes.
5. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, for 30 to 35 minutes (or until lentils and vegetables are tender). Remove bay leaf.
6. Using an immersion blender, pulse about 3 times to puree a small portion of the lentils and vegetables. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can transfer about 1 or 2 cups of the soup to a regular blender to puree. Stir the pureed portion into the rest of the soup to give the soup a thicker, creamier texture.
7. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and garnish each serving with the reserved crispy bacon and chopped fresh parsley.
