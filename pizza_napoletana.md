# Pizza Napoletana

**Type:** Entree
**Makes:** 4 8" to 10" Pizzas

## Ingredients:
- $4\frac{3}{4}$ Cups + 1 Tablespoon All-Purpose Flour (579g)
- $1\frac{3}{4}$ Cups Warm Water (406g)
- 1 Tablespoon Fine Salt (12g)
- 1 Teaspoon Dry Instant Yeast (3g)
- Olive Oil for greasing containers
- Cornmeal or semolina for dusting baker's peel
- Toppings as desired

## Steps:
### Day One:
1. Whisk together dry ingredients
2. Add water and mix until the dough forms a shaggy mass, resisting urge to add more flour
3. Cover and set at room temperature for 2 hours, folding after the first hour
4. Divide dough into 4 pieces, preshape as rounds, and place in individual oiled plastic containers
5. Seal lids and chill overnight or up to 48 hours
### Day Two:
1. Remove containers from refrigerator and allow to warm to room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. A good trick is to flour work surface, then take off lids and invert containers, letting the doughs gently fall and settle as they warm.
2. About an hour before baking, preheat oven to 500$^\circ$F with a baking stone or pizza steel placed in the upper third of the oven
3. Once doughs have warmed, lift inverted containers off dough pieces and flour top of dough generously
4. Gengtly pat piece of dough to remove any large air bubbles and stretch it into a small round, 4" to 5" in diameter
5. Next, working with your fingertips and starting in the center of the dough, press down and move outward in concentric circles dimpling the gas from the dough, leaving an inch of rim untouched around the entire piece. Check periotically to see if additional flour is needed under the dough. If it sticks, release it gently with a bench knife and add more flour.
6. Holding only the outer rim of the dough and leaving the dough in contact with the bench, work around the perimeter, streching gently, slowly coaxing the dough into a thin round 9" to 10" in diameter. If the dough resists being streched, cover it and allow it to rest and relax for 20 to 30 minutes
7. Turn the preheated oven to broil
8. Generously sprinkle a wooden peel with semolina or cornmeal and place the dough on it, jiggling the peel forward and backward to ensure the dough isn't sticking.
9. Top the pizza as desired, leaving a $\frac{1}{2}$" margin around the outside of the pizza with no toppings
10. Slide pizza onto the preheated stone or pizza steel and set a 3 minute timer
11. When the timer goes off, rotate the pizza 180$^\circ$ and reset for 1 minute
12. Be prepared with tongs and a plate, a cooling rack, or a cutting board to take the pizza out. The toppings should be well cooked and the dough around the edges should be dark
13. Before loading the next pizza, check that the stone or steel is clean of dusting cornmeal or semolina
